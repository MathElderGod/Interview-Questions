 * I was asked this coding question by EPIC solutions.
 * Now, at the time, I realize I did a terrible job implementing the solution under 
 * the stress of the assessment timer. 
 *
 * Why don't companies just give you a programming assignment, and just have you turn
 * it in by a much broader and leniant deadline? A man can dream.....(AI ofcourse is 
 * the reason why.)
 *
 * Anyways, here we go.
 *
 * Interview Question:
 *
 * You are part of a lottery verification team. So far, there are two seperate lottery events  
 * going on at the same time. Each event has participants put down their phone numbers on a list. 
 * Particpants are only allowed to put down one phoner number down, and are no longer allowed to 
 * participate in any other events for the lottery as a whole. Some particpants however, decided to 
 * violate the rules, and they have put down their phone numbers in the other list as well. 
 * Write a program saves each users phone numbers, sorts them, and removes any cheaters from the 
 * overall lottery population. Return a SORTED list such that it is a list fully comprising of
 * the phone numbers of individuals that did not cheat.
