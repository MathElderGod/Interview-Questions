# Interview Questions:
I solve interview questions that I have encountered throughout my life....

Please do not simply clone my solutions and make them your own. 

### Why does this exist? 

Becuase I would like a place to practice and show my commitment to solving problems
that I have encountered throughout my job hunting journey. 
I am an avid VIM user and an avid lover of the C programming language. I guess I am a _masochist_? 
I plan on having various implementations with different languages, and plan on having other cool directories involving more than just interviewing questions. 

Feel free to explore this repository to your hearts content! :)
