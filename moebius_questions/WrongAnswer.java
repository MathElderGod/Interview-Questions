   QUESTION 5: Wrong Result
   ----------------

   The following program produces inconsistent results. It should always output
   this: ``` counter is 20000
   ``` Please correct the program. ```

/**
 * Answer: 
 *
 * The issue with this program arises from race conditions. The counter variable is shared between two threads, 
 * and without synchronization, both threads attempt to increment counter simultaneously. This causes inconsistent 
 * results because the threads are not properly coordinated and might overwrite each otherâ€™s updates.
 * In a multi-threaded program, when threads share resources like the counter variable, synchronization 
 * ensures that only one thread can modify the counter at a time, preventing unexpected behavior caused by concurrent updates.
 * 
 * To fix the issue, I used the synchronized keyword on the doSomeFakeWork method. This guarantees 
 * that only one thread can execute this method at a time, ensuring that counter is correctly incremented and always ends up at the expected value.
 *
 * Solution: By adding the synchronized keyword, it ensures that the counter is safely incremented by each thread in turn, eliminating race conditions and providing consistent results.
